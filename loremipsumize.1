.B loremipsumize
[infile]

.SH DESCRIPTION
This script is a helper tool intended to let you replace the actual content
of your Lyx file to meaningless blind text (lorem ipsum) so you can send it
in along with your bugreports about eLyXer. 
It will replace all alphanumeric texts longer than two words with
"lorem ipsum" and leave the symbols. It is not 100% bulletproof so please
review your documents before sending for any confidential information left.
